# Spring Cloud Gateway Routing Example

An example project that illustrates how to tweak [Spring Cloud Gateway's](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-gateway) default routing.

# Use-case

Out of the box Spring Cloud Gateway comes with rather flexible but ultimately simple routing. It goes like this:

* [`RoutePredicateHandlerMapping` class](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-gateway/blob/v3.0.0-M6/spring-cloud-gateway-server/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/gateway/handler/RoutePredicateHandlerMapping.java) will go over all registered routes in order.
* Each route has a single (asynchronous) predicate that gets a chance to match the incoming exchange object.
* First route to match is validated (out of the box validation does nothing) and picked as the route to use for the given request.

This is powerful because predicate can be entirely overridden with custom logic. However, the "first match" strategy puts a lot of burden on the ordering of routes. Consider 2 routes with following path patterns:

1. `/1/*`
1. `/1/bars`

Given HTTP request to path `/1/bars`, should it be handled by route 1 or route 2?

With a sizeable API gateway this issue becomes more and more pronounced. There are 2 contributing factors:

1. Routes might be dynamically added at runtime, making it impossible to assert the correct order in advanced.
1. With large enough API surface it becomes increasingly likely that some otherwise generic endpoints will need to be overridden and handled as special cases. For example one service might be capable of handling `/{v}/bars` in general, but `/2/bars` is a special case that should be handheld by a dedicated micro-service.

# Getting started

In case you want to run the app yourself, feel free to clone the git repo and play around with it.

### Prerequisites

This projct uses:

* [Java 15](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/15/)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)

### Installing

Like with any maven project, you can:

```shell script
$ mvn clean install
```

## Testing

Tests use  [WireMock](http://wiremock.org/) to simulate the downstream server and [`WebTestClient`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/test/web/reactive/server/WebTestClient.html) to simulate the client. Test boots up the app and then makes HTTP requests, which are proxied to the WireMock server.

You can run test with maven:

```shell script
$ mvn test
```
